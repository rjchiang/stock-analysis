# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to expand a dataset of the entire stock market over the last few years. With refactoring,
coding becomes more efficient with fewer steps, less memory, or improved logic.

From the Images shown above, it appears the stock performance has decreased from years 2017 to 2018 due to the
increasing number of red highlights. Also, the execution times of the refactored script takes less than that of 
the original script, taking approximately 0.13 sec for the former compared to 0.80 sec for the latter.

## Summary

While refactoring code allows it to be easier and less complex to understand and read, it consumes a lot of time and
has high chance of making mistakes. With the original VBA script, it would be more specific to understand, at the 
cost of time in the process and difficulty of perfecting it.
